# Irish Dialect Classifier
This is a set of tools used to train a model to classify three main dialect groups of the Irish language: Ulster, Connacht, Munster. The classifier uses a model trained on a large corpus of Irish to detect Irish dialect either at the document or sentence level.

Dependencies
-------------
* Python 2.7.x
* sklearn >= 0.17

If you want to train your own model, you'll need the _Nua-Chorpas na hÃ‰ireann_/_The New Corpus for Ireland_ available upon request [here](https://focloir.sketchengine.co.uk/run.cgi/index). This is a large corpus of >30 million Irish words from various texts in Irish. **Note:** I am not affiliated with the creators of the corpus, and thus I cannot grant access to the corpus itself.
